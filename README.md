# se4demo2024
This is our team's project repository, in which we are building a webpage for folks who want to learn about being a CS major.

Most of the time on this project was on the landing images, text functions, and responsiveness. Please resize the pages and watch the animations for the full experience!

(images at the bottom of the pages are links!)
(colored text are links!)
(the red button looking things on the index page are NOT links or buttons)
